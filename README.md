This project provides an HTML template to make a PNG file including texts generated from the markdown source. 

We have created an HTML template to create a PNG file including texts generated from the Markdown source. Users can edit the Markdown source in the textarea in the template. The markdown source is automatically converted to HTML with an H1, H2, or P block and then converted to a downloadable PNG file.
